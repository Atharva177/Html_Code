                    Ronaldo was nicknamed “cry-baby” as a child. His mother Dolores Aveiro said:
                     “When he got home from school I’d tell him to do homework but he'd say he
                      didn’t have any. I'd be making dinner and he would jump out of the window 
                      and run off until late. He used to cry when he passed and his friends didn't 
                      score. People called him 'cry-baby' and 'Little Bee' because of nobody could
                       catch him."

                    Ronaldo was popular with other students at the school, but he was expelled at the 
                    age of 14 after he threw a chair at his teacher. Ronaldo said the reason he did it
                     was that the teacher disrespected him. Despite it being a negative thing, it turned
                      into a great turning point in his life. His mother then encouraged him to focus all
                       his attention on soccer which he did and turned him into an international sensation.

                    His first professional game for Sporting Lisbon came when he plays in the "Portuguese Super League" 
                    match at the age of 17 and that was the start of a journey which will make him one of the greatest players ever.
